        As it turns out, I'm still alive.
        <br><br>
        It's been a very long time (years) since
        I've blogged about anything substantial. I started my original blog
        (blog.josiahbruner.com) when I was 14 years old and began by posting
        rather cringy articles about cell phone use at amusements park as well
        as some commentary on my work on the Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
        projects. My blogging life mostly concluded in 2014 after I shared
        how I replicated an <a href="http://blog.josiahbruner.com/2014/12/lollipop-css-effects.html"> old Android UI element in CSS</a>.
        <br><br>
        It's now 2020 and lots has happened. I graduated high school, went to
        UMich and got my BS in computer science, got married started at Georgia
        Tech as a MS student, interned at multiple companies woring on
        development and security. I now work full-time at Duo Security doing
        security-focused software engineering.
        <br><br>
        I think it's time to bring back blogging. I have a lot more thoughts on
        the world, and tons of things I'm excited to learn about. Hopefully I
        will be more diligent about sharing these endeavors.
        <br><br>
        On a technical note: I am deprecating blog.josiahbruner.com and will
        post static content here (josiahbruner.com/blog) from now on. I'll be
        honest, this is largely because I'm lazy and don't want to deal with
        properly configuring HTTPS on Blogger, but also because I enjoy
        implementing stuff from scratch as much as possible.
        <br><br>
        Be on the lookout for more posts on software, security, and more!
